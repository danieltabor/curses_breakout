# Curses Breakout
I have a tendency to make fun little scripts when I need to give my mind a break, particularly when doing intensive work while on travel.  This is a text-based (curses) version of breakout written in Python.  The computer I was working on was limited, and I wanted to try to do something action oriented in the "old school" style.
